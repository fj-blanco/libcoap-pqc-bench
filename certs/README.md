# Post-Quantum Certificates Generation

For the generation of post-quantum certificates, run the following script

```bash
./generate_certs.sh
```

This requires the installation of the [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) for OpenSSL. You can find installation instructions under the folder `certs/oqs-provider_install`.
